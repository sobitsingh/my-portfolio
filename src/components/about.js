        <p>
          I am an AWS-certified Business Architecture Senior Analyst at Accenture Japan, specializing in cloud solutions. In my current role on the Global OSS team, I use AWS services like Grafana, Docker, and InfluxDB to create real-time data dashboards. I also explore OpenAI integration with Python on AWS for scalability. Previously, as a Business Architecture Analyst, I optimized application source code for cloud migration projects using AWS's Cast Highlight Tool. I hold AWS certifications including Solutions Architect - Associate, Developer - Associate, and Cloud Practitioner. I have expertise in AWS services and strong technical skills in Java, C++, Python, and AI frameworks.
